I am a senior Web Application Developer who has been been developing web based
solutions for well over a decade and have worked with many different technology stacks
throughout my career. I have worked extensively with PHP-based content management
systems such as [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), decoupled applications with modern [React](https://reactjs.org/) front ends, and leading-edge
[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) solutions developed for serverless architecture.
