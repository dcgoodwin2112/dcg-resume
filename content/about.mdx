I am a senior Web Application Developer with over a decade of experience developing
web-based solutions on many different technology stacks. Throughout my career, I
have worked extensively with php-driven content management systems such as
[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), decoupled applications with modern
[React](https://reactjs.org/) front ends, and leading-edge [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/)
solutions developed for serverless architecture.
